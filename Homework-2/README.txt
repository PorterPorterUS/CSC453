How to run: enter the folder 'enum_test', and tye 'ruby cs253EnumTest.rb'
Cool or extra things: for each function, test it using 5 cases

Other stuff:
If you want to test it using your own Triple class and encounter errors, please: 
1. include Enumerable in the Triple class
2. Add a 'length' function which just returns 3
